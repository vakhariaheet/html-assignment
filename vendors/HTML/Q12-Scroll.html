		<h1>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
		<p>
			While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript
			is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data
			Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript
			including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by
			creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even
			calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.
		</p>
		<p>
			Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or
			paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming
			(FP).
		</p>
		<h3>Basic JavaScript</h3>
		<p>
			JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages
			interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with
			HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in
			JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and
			strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops,
			if/else statements, and more.
		</p>
		<h3>Comment Your JavaScript Code</h3>
		<p>
			Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
			Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people
			who will later need to figure out what that code does.
		</p>
		<p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
		<p>
			Using <b color="grey"> //</b> will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder
			of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:
		</p>
		<code>// This is an in-line comment.</code>
		<p>
			You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */.
			This is a multi-line comment:
		</p>
		<code>
			/* This is a <br />
			multi-line comment */
		</code>
		<p>
			NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the
			function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the
			intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.
		</p>
		<h3>Declare JavaScript Variables</h3>
		<p>
			In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
			JavaScript provides eight different data types which are
			<b>undefined</b>, <b>null</b>, <b>boolean</b>, <b>string</b>,
			<b>symbol</b>, <b>bigint</b>, <b>number</b>, and <b>object</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number
			<b> 12</b>, and <b> strings </b>, such as <b> "12"</b>,<b> "dog"</b>, or
			<b>"123 cats"</b>, which are collections of characters. Computers can
			perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.
		</p>
		<p>
			Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic
			fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than
			using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a
			variable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics,
			which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer
			to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can
			store different values at different times.
		</p>
		<p>
			We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword
			var in front of it, like so:
		</p>
		<code> var outName; </code>
		<p>
			creates a variable called <b> ourName</b>. In JavaScript we end statements
			with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and
			<b> $</b> or <b>_</b>, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
		</p>
		<h3>Storing Values with the Assignment Operator</h3>
		<p>
			In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment
			operator (<b>=</b>).
		</p>
		<code>var myVariable = 5;</code>
		<p>This assigns the Number value, <b>5</b> to <b> myVariable</b>.</p>
		<p>
			If there are any calculations to the right of the <b>=</b> operator, those
			are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of
			the operator.
		</p>
		<code
			>var myVar; <br />
			myVar = 5;
		</code>
		<p>
			First, this code creates a variable named <b> myVar</b>. Then, the code
			assigns <b> 5</b> to <b>myVar</b>. Now, if <b> myVar</b> appears again in
			the code, the program will treat it as if it is <b>5</b>.
