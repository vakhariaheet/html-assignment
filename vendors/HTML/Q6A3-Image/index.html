		<h4>1. What is UX design?</h4>
		<p>
			Before we explore what a UX designer does, it’s important to first
			establish what UX design actually is. UX design focuses on the interaction
			between real human users (like you and me) and everyday products and
			services, such as websites, apps, and even coffee machines.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s an extremely varied discipline, combining aspects of psychology,
			business, market research, design, and technology. If you’d like to look
			at these in more depth, we’ve produced a handy guide to the different
			areas of UX design.
		</p>
		<p>
			As you can see, UX designers are expected to wear many different hats!
			We’ll take a closer look at what a UX designer does in section two. First,
			let’s consider where the term UX design comes from and how it has evolved.
		</p>
		<p>
			UX is not new. In fact, the term has been around since the early nineties,
			coined by <span> Donald Norman</span> when he worked for Apple as a
			cognitive scientist.
		</p>
		<p>
			Norman was interested in all aspects of a user’s experience with a product
			or service, including industrial design, graphics, the interface, and
			physical interaction. To encompass all of the different elements that
			determine how a user feels while interacting with a product, he came up
			with the term “user experience.”
		</p>
		<p>
			You can delve deeper into the history of UX design in our article on it.
			If you’re looking for a really in-depth exploration of UX design, then I’d
			recommend this UX guide—or simply watch this short video for a more gentle
			introduction from my fellow designer, Dee:
