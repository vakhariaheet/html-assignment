		<h1>Analysis</h1>
		<p>
			<b>Analysis</b> is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance
			into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The
			technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since
			before Aristotle, though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively
			recent development.
