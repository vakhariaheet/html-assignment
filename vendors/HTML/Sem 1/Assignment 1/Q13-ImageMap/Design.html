		<h1>Design</h1>
		<p>
			The <b> design </b> phase deals with learning objectives, assessment
			instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning,
			and media selection. The design phase should be systematic and specific.
			Systematic means a logical, orderly method of identifying, developing and
			evaluating a set of planned strategies targeted for attaining the
			project's goals. Specific means each element of the instructional design
			plan must be executed with attention to details.
