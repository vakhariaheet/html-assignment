		<h3>(New) Responsive Web Design</h3>
		<p>
			In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages
			that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
			for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. First, you'll
			build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll
			learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best
			practices for accessibility by building a quiz site. Finally, you'll learn
			how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a
			photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
