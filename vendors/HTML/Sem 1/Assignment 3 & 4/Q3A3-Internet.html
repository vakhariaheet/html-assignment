		<h1>Internet</h1>
		<p>
			The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected
			computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to
			communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that
			consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks
			of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless,
			and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of
			information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext
			documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail,
			telephony, and file sharing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet
			switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of
			Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers.[2] The primary
			precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for
			interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s.
			The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone
			in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions,
			led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking
			technologies, and the merger of many networks.[3] The linking of
			commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the
			beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,[4] and generated a
			sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal,
			and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet
			was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated
			its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
