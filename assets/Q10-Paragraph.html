			<h3>JavaScript</h3>
			<p>
				<b> JavaScript (JS)</b> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
				compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is
				most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
				non-browser environments also use it, such as <u> Node.js</u>,<u>
					Apache CouchDB </u
				>and <u> Adobe Acrobat.</u> JavaScript is a prototype-based,
				multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
				object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
				programming) styles.

				elements. <u>Elements </u> are surrounded by matching opening and
				closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<>). There
				are a few empty or void tags that cannot enclose any text

			<h3>Python</h3>
			<p>
				Python is a
				<u>high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language </u> .
				Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
				significant indentation. Python is <i>dynamically-typed</i> and
				<i> garbage-collected </i>. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
				including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
				functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included"
				language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum
				began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC
				programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
				Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list
				comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting,
				and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision
				that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python
				2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

			<h3>TypeScript</h3>
			<p>
				TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and
				maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of
				JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is
				designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to
				JavaScript.[5] As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript
				programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

			<h3>Java</h3>
			<p>
				Java is a <b> programming language</b> and a <b> platform</b>. Java is a
				<i> high level </i>,<i>robust </i> ,<i> object-oriented </i>and
				<i> secure programming language </i>. Java was developed by Sun
				Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
				<u> James Gosling </u>is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its
				name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James
				Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
